> Personalized commitizen adapter based on Angular's conventional standard.

This adapter is basically a rewrite of the official `cz-conventional-changelog`
adapter. The main differences ( and benefits ) are:

- Add `[ci skip]` automatically for `docs` and `chore` types
- Change max line width to the more standard 72 ( from 100 )
- Cut dependencies down from 6 to 2

## installation

```console
npm i -D @citycide/cz-conventional
```

You'll also need commitizen:

```console
npm i -D commitizen

# or, global installation
npm i -g commitzen
```

## usage

See ["Making your repo Commitizen-friendly"][cz-help1] and
["Using the command line tool"][cz-help2] on the commitizen cli repo
for detailed instructions.

To easily set up your own repo with this adapter, you can use:

```console
commitizen init @citycide/cz-conventional --save-dev
```
